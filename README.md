# Image classification on limited dataset
This report summarizes our work in a Kaggle-style Deep learning competition focused on image classification with limited training data. The goal of the competition was to classify images using only 50 training samples from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We were tasked with exploring various neural network architectures and machine learning algorithms to maximize classification accuracy on this small sample. Through rigorous experimentation and systematic evaluation of different modeling approaches, we were able to achieve the second place ranking in the competition. We employed techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, model ensembling, activation function selection, and regularization to carefully optimize performance. This report details our full methodology, including pre-processing, model development, training procedures, results analysis, and lessons learned. In the end, we were able to demonstrate state-of-the-art methods for tackling the challenging problem of learning from extremely small labeled datasets.

Challenge 1 Method 1:Machine learning models

The best performing model in Challenge 1 Method 1 was Logistic Regression. The specific hyperparameters used were:

Algorithm: 
- Logistic Regression

Hyperparameters:

- Solver: liblinear
- Penalty: l2
- C (inverse of regularization strength): 1.0
- Multi-class reduction: 'ovr'

Training parameters:

- Batch size: 128
- Number of iterations/epochs: 100

Preprocessing:
- Standard scaling of features

This Logistic Regression model with default hyperparameters achieved the highest average accuracy of 70% across 25 trials on the 50 image CIFAR-10 dataset when used within the AdaBoost ensemble in Method 1.

Some key points:

Logistic Regression is well-suited for binary classification problems.
Using L2 penalty helped prevent overfitting on small dataset.
Default hyperparameters were sufficient, no need for tuning.
Standard scaling normalized input features for good performance.
So in summary, out of the models evaluated in Method 1, logistic regression with above default hyperparameters worked best for this task.

Challenge 1 Method 2: Custom Deep-learning models
The best performing model in Challenge 1 Method 2 had the following hyperparameters:

Model Architecture:

- 3 convolutional layers 2 fully connected layers

Optimizer:
- AdaDelta optimizer

Activation Function:
- SiLU activation function

Regularization:
- Batch normalization after each convolutional layer
- Dropout of 0.25 after each fully connected layer

Learning Rate Scheduler:
- MultiStepLR scheduler with initial lr of 0.1 decayed by 0.1 at epochs 50 and 75

Other Hyperparameters:
- Batch size of 128
- 100 training epochs
- Weight decay of 0.001

This model achieved an average test accuracy of 79.28% +/- 6.73% across different training instances. The key aspects that led to its success were the AdaDelta optimizer, SiLU activation, moderate regularization with batch norm and dropout, and gradual learning rate decay. The moderate depth of 3 conv layers also helped prevent overfitting on the limited dataset.

Challenge 1 Method 3: Larger- Deep Learning Models

The best performing model in Challenge 1 Method 3 had the following hyperparameters:

Model Architecture:
- VGG16 style architecture with 3 blocks of conv + max pool layers

Regularization:
- Adversarial regularization 
- Max norm regularization of 5

Activation Function:
- SiLU activation

Optimizer:
- AdaDelta optimizer

Other Hyperparameters:

- Batch size of 128
- 100 training epochs
- Initial learning rate of 0.1 decayed by 0.1 at epochs 50 and 75
- Dropout of 0.25
- Weight decay of 0.0005

This model achieved the highest average test accuracy of 79.24% +/- 7.25% across different runs.

The key aspects were:

- Using a larger VGG-style architecture to learn richer representations
- Strong regularization with adversarial and max norm techniques
- SiLU activation for its benefits over ReLU
- AdaDelta optimizer for convergence

The robust regularization allowed training of a more complex model on the limited dataset without overfitting.

Challenge 2: Classification using external dataset pre-training

Method 1: Pre-training large models on external datasets

Models used:

- AlexNet
- ResNet18
- MobileNetV2
- EfficientNetB0

Pre-training datasets:

- ImageNet
- STL-10
- MNIST (for AlexNet only)

Pre-training hyperparameters:

- Batch size: 128
- Epochs: 10-20 (depended on model capacity)
- Optimizer: SGD
- Learning rate: 0.1 decayed by 0.1 every 5 epochs
- Momentum: 0.9
- Weight decay: 0.0001
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters:

Optimizer: SGD (as pre-trained)
Batch size: 64
Epochs: 50
Learning rate: 0.01 decayed by 0.1 every 20 epochs

Best results on CIFAR-10 validation set:

AlexNet & ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet achieved 92% accuracy
MobileNet pre-trained on ImageNet achieved 79.6% accuracy
Key aspects: Using large pre-trained models, moderate hyperparameters, transfer learning through fine-tuning on limited CIFAR-10 data helped maximize performance.

In summary, each challenge methodically explored techniques like architecture design, hyperparameters, activations, regularization and transfer learning to optimize performance on the limited CIFAR-10 sample.
